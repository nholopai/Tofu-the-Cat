# Tofu-the-Cat
My very first website about my cat, Tofu.
Hi there! This was the first website I ever made using both HTML and CSS. I would like to fix the website so that it is more responsive to different screen sizes, such as mobile and tablets, however I am having trouble fixing my code to do that, especially with re-sizing the header and footer.
I would really appreciate some help on this, as I feel that I have reached a dead end with this, despite how many changes I have experimented with this.
Thank you!
